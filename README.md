# Getting Started

Follow these steps to get it up and running.

To use Toolorant you need to have **Python** on your computer.

## Python

Python is the program used to run the Toolorant files.
To install Python just follow this simple tutorial: <https://realpython.com/installing-python>.

## Toolorant

To get the latest version of Toolorant, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/Davi-S/Toolorant/releases) on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Davi-S/Toolorant).
2. Look for the latest release version and click on it to open the release notes.
3. You'll find download links for the release. Download the zip file, save it on your computer, and extract it anywhere you want.

## Setup

Once you have Python and Toolorant on your computer, open the Toolorant folder and double-click the `setup.bat` file.

It will open a terminal window to perform some tasks to make Toolorant run on your computer. It should take less than one minute. The window will close automatically and you can proceed to the next step.

You only need to do this once.

## Run it

On the Toolorant folder there is a "`src\`" folder; just double-click on "`desktop`" to open Toolorant!

If you want, you can [create a shortcut](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/create-desktop-shortcut-windows-10#:~:text=Create%20Desktop%20Shortcut%20in%20Windows%2010.%201%5D%20The,shortcut%20has%20been%20created%20on%20your%20Windows%20desktop.) for the `desktop.py` on your desktop

**If you did not manage to get Toolorant up and running, check the [Support and community](#support-and-community) topic to get support.**

# Is This "bannable"?

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

No **bans** have been reported so far from using this program.
Some players reported receiving a two-week competitive **suspension** for using the instalocker tool excessively

This program does not use an auto-clicker, read the game's memory or files; therefore, the anti-cheat should not be triggered.

However, using the VALORANT API in this manner is against Riot's Terms of Service, since you are getting an advantage over other players. So there is always a risk.
