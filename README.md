## Getting Started

1. Find the **latest release** on the [releases page](https://github.com/Davi-S/Toolorant/releases) of the [project repository](https://github.com/Davi-S/Toolorant).

2. Download the executable version from the assets section.
   - If you encounter a false positive warning, you can safely proceed.
  If you don't trust the exe file, you can download the source code, (read it to confirm that there is no virus) and compile it yourself or run with the python interpreter. If you need help on this process, ask for it on our [Discord Community](#support-and-community)

3. Save it on your computer and run the `Toolorant.exe` file
   - If you get an error message or if it just doesn't open it's probably because Toolorant is missing "controlled folder access" permission on Windows Defender. Follow [this tutorial](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/allow-an-app-to-access-controlled-folders-b5b6627a-b008-2ca2-7931-7e51e912b034) to learn how to add this permission to an app, or ask for support on our [Discord Community](#support-and-community)

If you want, you can [create a shortcut](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/create-desktop-shortcut-windows-10#:~:text=Create%20Desktop%20Shortcut%20in%20Windows%2010.%201%5D%20The,shortcut%20has%20been%20created%20on%20your%20Windows%20desktop.) for it on your desktop

**If you did not get Toolorant up and running, check the [Support and Community](#support-and-community) topic to get support.**

## Is This "bannable"?

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

No **bans** have been reported so far from using this program.
Some players reported receiving a two-week competitive **suspension** for using the Instalocker tool excessively.

This program does not use an auto-clicker, or read the game's memory; therefore, the anti-cheat should not be triggered.

However, using the VALORANT API in this manner is against Riot's Terms of Service, since you are getting an advantage over other players. So there is always a risk.
