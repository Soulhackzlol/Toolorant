# Getting Started

1. Find the **latest release** on the [releases page](https://github.com/Davi-S/Toolorant/releases) of the [project repository](https://github.com/Davi-S/Toolorant).

2. Scroll down to assets and download one of the executable versions.
   - All versions of the executable are essentially the same. If one doesn't work for you, you can try another.
   - You may get a virus warning, but this is a false positive and you can safely download it.
  If you don't trust the exe file, you can download the source code, (read it to confirm that there is no virus) and compile it yourself. If you need help on this process, ask for it on our [Discord Community](#support-and-community)

3. Save it on your computer and extract it to a location of your preference.

4. Find the `tolorant.exe` file and run it.
   - If you get an error message it's probably because Toolorant is missing "controlled folder access" permission on Windows. Follow [this tutorial](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/allow-an-app-to-access-controlled-folders-b5b6627a-b008-2ca2-7931-7e51e912b034) to learn how to add this permission to an app, or ask for support on our [Discord Community](#support-and-community)

If you want, you can [create a shortcut](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/create-desktop-shortcut-windows-10#:~:text=Create%20Desktop%20Shortcut%20in%20Windows%2010.%201%5D%20The,shortcut%20has%20been%20created%20on%20your%20Windows%20desktop.) for it on your desktop

**If you did not get Toolorant up and running, check the [Support and community](#support-and-community) topic to get support.**

# Is This "bannable"?

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

No **bans** have been reported so far from using this program.
Some players reported receiving a two-week competitive **suspension** for using the instalocker tool excessively.

This program does not use an auto-clicker, or read the game's memory/files; therefore, the anti-cheat should not be triggered.

However, using the VALORANT API in this manner is against Riot's Terms of Service, since you are getting an advantage over other players. So there is always a risk.
